I would like to thank my parents for their support and encouragement over all these five years.  I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisors Duarte Nuno Jardim Nunes and Sabrina Scuri for their insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this Thesis possible.


My grateful thanks are also extended to the SMILE project team from M-ITI for their contribution to this project, especially to Eng. Daniel Garigali Pestana for all the help, even after hours. 

To all my friends and colleagues that helped me grow as a person and were always there for me during the good and bad times in my IST student journey -- Thank you.

Finally, I wish to thank to all the participants in the study.
