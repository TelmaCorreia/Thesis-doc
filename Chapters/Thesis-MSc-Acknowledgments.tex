I would like to thank my parents for their support and encouragement over all these five years. 

I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisors Duarte Nuno Jardim Nunes and Sabrina Scuri for their insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this Thesis possible.

Last but not least, to all my friends and colleagues that helped me grow as a person and were always there for me during the good and bad times in my life. Thank you.

To each and every one of you -- Thank you.
